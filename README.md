# QuizApplication_STQA
We have developed a web application to take quizzes on any topic. The application starts with a login/registration form. The participant needs to register first, after successful registration participant’s details are added to the database. After this, the user can login and attempt a quiz. Once logged in with registered credentials, the quiz starts with the first question loaded with a timer. Participant selects an answer and clicks the next button. Once answered, he can’t navigate back to the previous question. Participant have to answer all the questions within time. Either the user has answered all questions or the timer is over, the result screen shows the analysis of performance. User clicks the exit button to get back to the homepage. This application is useful in conducting online tests from remote places. The quiz can be given at your own convenience at any time and place.
